I am a third year PhD candidate in the [ML foundations](https://mlfoundations.org/) group at [Harvard University](https://seas.harvard.edu/) advised by [David Alvarez-Melis](https://dmelis.github.io/). I am thankful to be supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program). My research focuses on principled data-centric approaches for adapting and understanding LLMs. Recently, I have been working on finding ways to compress and connect models across scales and tasks.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/), where I worked with [Anima Anandkumar](https://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) and [R. Michael Alvarez](https://www.rmichaelalvarez.com) on scalable tensor-based topic modeling methods.
