Released the preprint for my work ðŸªƒ [Boomerang Distillation Enables Zero-Shot Model Size Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05064) ðŸªƒ. We uncover boomerang distillation, a surprising phenomenon by which we can create a full family of models of fine-grained sizes with no additional training by interpolating between a pretrained and distilled model.
